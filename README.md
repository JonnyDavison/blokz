## Testing 
Testing throughout the development process ensured the functionality and flow gave both good UX and UI. Testing led to bugs in User movement being ironed out stopping 'jumpy' Slider movement, further increasing the UX. 

As development moved to responsiveness, media queries lead to code refactoring, and bug fixes.  

- Browser tests on Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    - Note that older versions of safari do not support .webp image format
- Responsiveness tests, Chrome dev tools
    - Tests resulted in additional breakpoints
-  Accessibility 
    - All components meet accessibility expectations, contrast and readability 
- External Links    
    - To further social media, open a separate tab to assist UX navigation
